This repository contains the code and documentation for the replication study of ["(Re-)Imag(in)ing Price Trends"](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3756587) by Jiang, Kelly, and Xiu (2023). The project demonstrates the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for financial market prediction using image representations of Open-High-Low-Close (OHLC) charts, with enhancements in interpretability and model architecture. 

 ## Abstract 

This study replicates and extends the original framework by:   

1. (Visualization)Using **Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)** to visualize critical pattern recognition regions in price trend images.   
2. (Sensitivity Analysis) Implemented controlled perturbations across critical design dimensions to evaluate the CNN architecture's predictive robustness.
